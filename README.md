# PopSmartKids
Web App Practicum course for North Seattle College's AD 410 course of the App Dev BAS.

The primary focus of this course is the application of the material learned in the associated development 
course, as well as information you have learned about software lifecycle, development tools, and software design and architecture. 

The students were divided into small teams to complete the development of web applications for a thirdÂ­party "customer". Our team
was chosen by the client and PopSmartKids.com will feature the website that our team created.
